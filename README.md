<p>Things you need to pay attention to for the Spring project to run successfully:</p>

<h3>1. Install the PostgreSQL database on your computer.</h3>

<p>Within the project, database tables are automatically created using Flyway. Since Flyway is configured to work specifically with PostgreSQL, errors may occur when using other databases.</p>

<h3>2. Configure yaml file</h3>

<p>Update the database's username and password information to be compatible with your own database.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a database named ecommerce_db</p>

<h3>3. Congratulations! You can now run the project ðŸŽ‰</h3>

<p>After running the project, you can navigate to "http://localhost:9001/docs/swagger-ui/index.html#/" to use the endpoints through the Swagger documentation.</p>
